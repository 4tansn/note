traceparent Header:

The main header that carries essential information about the trace.
Structure: version-traceId-parentId-flags
Version: Defines the format version of the header (currently 00).
Trace ID: A 16-byte unique identifier for the trace, used to connect all spans.
Parent ID: An 8-byte identifier for the span that caused this request (i.e., the parent span).
Flags: A 2-character flag used for sampling decisions (e.g., 01 for sampling enabled, 00 for disabled).
Example:

makefile
Copy
Edit
traceparent: 00-4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736-00f067aa0ba902b7-01
This indicates the request is part of trace 4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736 with the parent span ID 00f067aa0ba902b7, and sampling is enabled (01).
tracestate Header:

Provides additional vendor-specific information about the trace.
This allows different tracing systems (like Dynatrace, OpenTelemetry, Jaeger) to attach their own metadata while maintaining interoperability.
Example: tracestate: vendor1=value1,vendor2=value2.
Propagation Mechanism:

When a service handles an incoming request, it reads the traceparent header and continues the trace, creating a child span.
This new span contains the same Trace ID but a new Parent ID, representing the span for the current service.
The sampling flag in the traceparent header indicates whether to record and export the trace (if 01) or not (if 00).
