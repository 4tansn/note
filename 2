# Chatbot UI with Backend Integration

This is a React-based chatbot interface that allows users to interact with a backend API. The chatbot processes user inputs and displays responses from the backend, handling text formatting such as newlines (`\n`), bullet points (`•`), and bold headers using `**`.

## Features

- **Backend Integration**: Sends user input to a backend API using a `POST` request and displays the response.
- **Text Formatting**: The UI supports structured text from the API, including:
  - Bold headers defined by `**`.
  - Newlines (`\n`) for line breaks.
  - Bullet points (`•`).
- **Dynamic Conversation**: Supports a chat interface with messages from both user and bot.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the UI components.
- **Material UI (MUI)**: For UI elements like buttons, text fields, and cards.
- **Axios**: For making API calls.
- **CSS Flexbox**: For layout management.
- **Typography**: For parsing and displaying formatted text.
