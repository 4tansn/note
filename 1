On [Date], I communicated with [Director's Name] regarding some challenges I have been facing under [Manager's Name]'s supervision. Since that conversation, I have experienced several retaliatory actions from my manager, including:

Reprimand for Communication: During a team call on [Date], [Manager's Name] explicitly stated that approaching [Director's Name] was unacceptable and instructed me not to do so again.

Threat of Performance Improvement Plan (PIP): He threatened to place me on a PIP starting next month, despite no prior indication of performance issues.

Solicitation of Feedback: He has begun soliciting feedback about me from other team members, which I fear may be biased given the current context.

Leave Approval Issues: Although my planned leave dates were communicated and approved a month ago, he insisted that I seek approval again, causing unnecessary confusion.

Critical Email and Exaggerated Complaints: On [Date], he sent a critical email questioning my intentions and listing numerous exaggerated complaints. He indicated that he will schedule regular meetings to address these complaints.

Withholding Support: On [Date], when I requested support for a task blocker, he not only failed to provide assistance but also instructed other team members not to help, hindering my ability to meet deadlines.

Mental Assault in One-on-One Meeting: Most recently, in a one-on-one meeting on [Date], he mentally assaulted me for speaking up about my concerns, adding to the already stressful situation.

These actions have created an untenable work environment, and I am deeply concerned about the impact on my professional well-being and performance. I believe it is crucial to address these issues promptly and seek your support in doing so.

I kindly request an urgent meeting to discuss this matter further and to explore possible resolutions. I am also requesting that this matter be kept confidential to avoid further escalation.

Thank you for your attention to this serious issue. I look forward to your prompt response.
