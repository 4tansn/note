I trust this message finds you well. I am reaching out to address some concerns regarding my current work situation and to seek your assistance in facilitating a team transfer within Barclays. 
In my current role, I have encountered significant challenges that have made it increasingly difficult for me to perform at my best. Specifically, I have found the deadlines set by my manager to be unrealistic. Despite my best efforts, I have not received the necessary support or guidance from my manager to navigate these challenges effectively. Instead, I have faced repeated verbal warnings, which have only compounded my feelings of frustration and anxiety.
Additionally, the type and scope of work assigned to me do not align with role description shared before and not related to that of a developer. Much of the work I have been tasked with, such as testing and mundane ad hoc tasks like hitting dozens of URLs in browser, polulating excel sheet etc
Having previously thrived in supportive and collaborative teams within Barclays, I am keenly aware of the positive impact that a conducive work environment can have on one's professional growth. Regrettably, my current circumstances do not reflect this, and I believe a change is necessary for me to continue to develop and contribute effectively.
Prior to joining my current team, I was forewarned about the demanding nature of the workload by my predecessor and cohort, GVR Karthik, as well as by my current manager, Dheeraj Verma.
Given these challenges, I kindly request your assistance in facilitating a transfer to another team where I can leverage my skills and capabilities more effectively, while also aligning with the values and culture of Barclays that I hold in high regard.
I appreciate your attention to this matter and am available to discuss further at your earliest convenience.
