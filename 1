Dear ,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a concerning issue that I have been experiencing in the workplace, and I am seeking your assistance in resolving it.

Recently, I expressed some challenges I have been facing in my role to my director, as I believed it was important for them to be aware of the difficulties I was encountering. Unfortunately, since then, I have been subjected to what I can only describe as retaliation from my manager. I have documented several incidents which I believe constitute retaliation and contribute to a hostile work environment:

During a team call, my manager explicitly warned me against approaching the director again and stated that such actions were unacceptable.
He threatened to place me on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) starting next month.
He has been soliciting negative feedback about me from other team members under his management.
Despite having already informed my manager about planned leave dates, which were also approved in the HR system, he forced me to seek approval again, causing unnecessary confusion.
Following my communication with the director, my manager sent me an email containing exaggerated complaints about my performance and stated his intention to schedule regular meetings to discuss these complaints further.
Instead of providing support when I encountered a blocker in my tasks, my manager prevented support from other team members via email, hindering my ability to meet deadlines.
These actions have created a highly stressful and toxic work environment for me, and I am concerned about the impact they may have on my well-being and professional reputation. I believe that such behavior is not only detrimental to my own work but also goes against the values of our company.
