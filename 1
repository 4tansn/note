Dear 
I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention several concerns regarding my current role and team assignment, as well as to request your assistance in facilitating a team change and role adjustment.
1.	Role Description Discrepancy: The initial role description for my team indicated a Java development-based role, which aligns with my career aspirations. However, upon joining, I was assigned a tester role, which deviates significantly from the advertised position.
2.	Unreasonable Workload: Despite lacking prior experience in testing, I have been tasked with assignments with fixed deadlines from day one. Additionally, I have not received proper training or induction into the testing role, making it challenging for me to meet these deadlines effectively.
3.	Warning from Line Manager: During a meeting with the line manager of my third rotation, it was explicitly mentioned that the team experiences an extreme workload. I was advised to explore alternate options, highlighting the potential challenges I would face in this environment.
4.	Feedback from Predecessor: My predecessor, GVR Karthik, also conveyed to me the overwhelming workload associated with the team after assignment, confirming the existing issues.
5.	Work from Home Arrangement and Medical Concerns: I submitted my medical records to my line manager on January 15, 2024, requesting an extension of the work-from-home arrangement. However, despite multiple follow-ups, the approval process has been delayed, causing uncertainty and affecting my ability to plan effectively.
6.	Denied Request for Java Development Work: Despite expressing my interest in exploring Java development during my third rotation, my request to be assigned Java development tasks, as per the role description, was denied by my line manager.
7.	Instructions from Line Manager: on 8th February 2024, when I followed up about the status of my work from home, he strictly instructed me not tomfollow-up about it again and instructed me to focus on meeting the strict deadline irrespective of my leaves on anchor days( since work from has not been approved yet) and my enrolment in Financial Markets Continued Learning Training 
I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to Sophie for her diligent efforts in addressing these concerns with my line manager. Despite her earnest endeavors, regrettably, the issues persist.
Now, I believe that your intervention is necessary to facilitate the required changes in my team assignment. Considering the above issues, I am left with no choice but to request a team change. My ultimate goal is to pursue a career as a Developer, and I believe that a team aligned with Java development would provide me with the necessary environment to achieve this goal.
I kindly request your intervention in facilitating a team change to one that preferably offers a Java development role. I am aware that many tech teams within Barclays are Java development-focused, and I am hopeful that such a transition would better align with my career aspirations and contribute to my professional growth.
I appreciate your attention to this matter and eagerly await your prompt response and support in resolving these issues.
