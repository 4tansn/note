Dear [Insurance Company Representative's Name],

I am writing in response to the deficiency letter requesting the original hospital bill for my recent claim.

Before my discharge from the hospital, I noticed that my address was incorrect on the initial bill. I informed the hospital, and they updated my address and generated a new bill with the correct details. The hospital took back the previous bill with the incorrect address, and the new bill, although marked as "duplicate," is in fact the original bill provided by the hospital after the address correction.

I submitted this corrected bill to your Bhubaneswar branch on 13th August 2024 and also informed Paramount representative Mr. Ashok Dash, who was present at the time, about the address update.

Please feel free to verify the authenticity of this bill with the hospital if necessary. I kindly request that you proceed with processing my claim based on the documents submitted.

Thank you for your understanding and support.
