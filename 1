Subject: Request for Extension of Work from Home Arrangement

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally request an extension of my current work-from-home arrangement, which was initially approved from February 14, 2024, to March 15, 2024.

As discussed previously, continuing to work from home has been tremendously beneficial for me in managing my health conditions and enabling me to perform my duties to the best of my abilities. The flexibility and comfort of the home environment have significantly contributed to my productivity and overall well-being.

Considering the ongoing circumstances and the positive outcomes observed during the previous period, I believe that extending the work-from-home arrangement would not only be advantageous for me personally but also ensure uninterrupted productivity and contribution to our team's objectives.

Therefore, I kindly request an extension of the work-from-home arrangement from March 18, 2024, to August 31, 2024. I assure you of my commitment to maintaining the same level of dedication and professionalism in executing my responsibilities remotely as I would in the office.
