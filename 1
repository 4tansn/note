Dear [HR Representative's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to urgently seek your intervention regarding a serious and escalating situation with my line manager, Dheeraj Verma. Since I reached out to [Director's Name] regarding the challenges I was facing, I have been subjected to retaliatory actions that are severely impacting my professional well-being.

The specific issues I am currently facing include:

Immediate Threat of PIP: My manager has again threatened to place me on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) for reaching out to the director.

Sidelining within the Team: He is actively sidelining me in the team, excluding me from important discussions and decision-making processes.

False Blame and Daily Micromanagement: He is making false accusations against me multiple times and is demanding daily status reports, creating an atmosphere of constant scrutiny and stress.

Given these retaliatory actions, it has become next to impossible for me to perform my duties effectively or to groom under such a hostile environment. I am deeply concerned that if this situation continues, it may lead to my termination.

In light of these circumstances, I urgently request a reassignment to a different team where I can work without fear of retaliation and undue pressure. I believe this change is necessary for my professional growth and mental well-being.
