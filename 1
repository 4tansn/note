As I am planning to relocate to Pune in the May, one of my parents will relocate with me to support me in initial months. During my preliminary discussions with various brokers, I have been surprised by the unexpectedly high rental costs and security deposits in the area. 
Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that my current annual salary of 17.43 lakh places me within the BA3 salary level. 
Reflecting on my initial offer upon joining Barclays two years ago, with an annual compensation of 16.2 lakh, I note that there has been minimal growth in my salary since then, despite my continued dedication and performance.
Considering these factors, along with the prevailing salary rates in the market and my professional qualifications, I kindly request that you consider a revision to my current salary to better reflect my contributions and the changing circumstances.
