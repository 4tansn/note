Subject: Status Update & Sign-Off Request for Couchbase DB Server Upgrade (E3 Cluster)

Dear Team,

This is to inform you that both the Paperless Service and DB-Accesser Utility are currently using Couchbase Java SDK version 3.3, which is compatible with Couchbase Server version 7.6.5.

We have successfully upgraded the Couchbase database servers in E1 and E2 environments to version 7.6.5. All services are working as expected post-upgrade.

We are now ready to proceed with upgrading the E3 Couchbase cluster to version 7.6.5.

Kindly review and provide your sign-off to initiate the upgrade in the E3 environment.

Best regards,
