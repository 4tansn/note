Dear [Manager's Name] and [HR Representative's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to provide a summary of the discussions we had during our meeting earlier today. Below are the key points that were covered:

Task Deadline: I have been assigned a task with a deadline set for completion by March 31st, 2024. I assured you both that I will dedicate myself to learning and working on this task simultaneously to ensure its timely and satisfactory completion.

Working Hours: I have confirmed that my standard working hours will be from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. During this period, I will be fully available for office-related tasks and responsibilities. However, it should be noted that I will not be generally available for office work outside of these specified working hours.

Work-From-Home Policy: Dheeraj has kindly agreed to handle work-from-home requests until March 15th, 2024. Any requests made up to this date will be reviewed and approved by the following Monday, which is February 19th, 2024. In light of this policy, I will need to take leave this Friday to ensure compliance and avoid any breach related to not working from the office.

Extension of Work from Home: Dheeraj has committed to checking with higher management regarding the possibility of extending the work-from-home arrangement beyond March 15th, 2024. He has assured us that he will provide an update on this matter preferably within two weeks and no later than March 8th, 2024.

I trust that this summary accurately reflects the discussions and agreements made during our meeting. Please do not hesitate to reach out if any further clarification or information is required. Thank you for your time and attention to these matters.
