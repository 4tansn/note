I am writing in response to the deficiency letter requesting the original hospital bill for my recent claim.

Before my discharge from the hospital, I noticed that my address was incorrect on the initial bill. I informed the hospital, and they updated my address and generated a new bill with the correct details. The hospital took back the previous bill with the incorrect address, and the new bill, although marked as "duplicate," is in fact the original bill provided by the hospital after the address correction.

I submitted this corrected bill, along with all required documents, to your Bhubaneswar branch on 13th August 2024 and informed Paramount representative Mr. Ashok Dash about the address update.

It has now been over a month since I submitted the required documents, including fulfilling previous deficiency requests such as getting reports signed by the MD and collecting indoor case papers from the hospital. Despite my efforts, I have not yet received the reimbursement.

I kindly request you to accelerate the processing of my claim as I have already complied with all the documentation requirements. Please feel free to verify the authenticity of the bills with the hospital if necessary, and I would appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.

Thank you for your understanding and support.
