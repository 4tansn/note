I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out regarding a recent modification we made to jar1 due to two high vulnerabilities identified. As a part of this process, it's crucial that we update the encrypted string stored in the Bcag vault.

To ensure a seamless update process, I would like to discuss the steps involved in updating the encrypted string in the vault. Could we please schedule a call at your earliest convenience to go over the process in detail?
